      ['Accounts', 'Customers are responsible for accurate profile, address, dog, and contact information.'],
      ['Owner responsibility', 'The dog owner or authorized caregiver remains responsible for determining whether the dog is healthy, suitable, and safe to participate. ZoomieVan may refuse, pause, or stop service if a dog appears unwell, unsafe, reactive, distressed, or otherwise unsuitable for a session.'],
      ['Non-refundable payments', 'All paid bookings, packages, deposits, and service fees are non-refundable unless ZoomieVan cancels the service and chooses, at its sole discretion, to issue a credit, reschedule, or refund. Missed appointments, late cancellations, inaccurate information, refusal for safety reasons, or owner-requested cancellations are not refundable.'],
      ['No guarantee of results', 'ZoomieVan does not guarantee specific fitness, behavioral, weight-loss, health, or training outcomes. Sessions are designed as supervised exercise support and are not veterinary care, medical treatment, or behavior therapy.'],
      ['Limitation of liability', 'To the fullest extent permitted by law, ZoomieVan, its owners, handlers, contractors, and affiliates are not responsible for injury, illness, escape, stress, behavioral incidents, property damage, indirect losses, or other claims arising from participation in or inability to participate in the service.'],

      ['Owner disclosure duty', 'Owners must disclose health conditions, medication, age concerns, prior injuries, aggression, bite history, fear, anxiety, reactivity, heat sensitivity, pregnancy, recent surgery, or any other issue that could affect safe participation.'],
      ['Dog safety responsibility', 'The owner acknowledges that ZoomieVan provides supervised mobile fitness support, but the owner remains responsible for the dog\'s health, suitability, behavior, and safety before, during, and after the session. ZoomieVan is not a veterinarian and does not provide medical clearance.'],
      ['Right to refuse or stop service', 'ZoomieVan may refuse, pause, shorten, or stop a session at any time if the handler believes continuing could be unsafe, unsuitable, or stressful for the dog, handler, property, or public. Such safety-based decisions do not create a refund obligation.'],
      ['Release of claims', 'To the fullest extent permitted by law, the owner releases ZoomieVan, its owners, handlers, contractors, and affiliates from claims, costs, damages, or losses connected to the dog\'s participation, except where a release is not permitted by applicable law.'],
      ['Health and vaccines', 'Dogs may be refused service if vaccine, parasite-prevention, health, or behavior requirements are incomplete or unsafe for the session.'],
      ['Media consent', 'Photo/video consent must include a clear opt-out path before production launch.'],
      ['Review required', 'This waiver should be finalized by the business owner and legal counsel before being used with customers.'],
